## 💡 How It Works

1. All buttons are selected using `document.querySelectorAll('.button')`.
2. When a button is clicked, an event listener triggers.
3. The `id` of the clicked button is checked.
4. Based on the `id`, the background color of the page is updated using:
```javascript
body.style.backgroundColor = 'colorName';
```
